# Vehicle Anomaly Detection

## About the Project
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in vehicle sensor data using machine learning techniques. It leverages **Autoencoder** and **Isolation Forest** models to identify unusual patterns in the data.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing vehicle sensor data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using Autoencoder and Isolation Forest to detect anomalies.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots to showcase the results.
